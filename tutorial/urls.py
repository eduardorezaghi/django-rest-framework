"""
Routers provide a convenient and consistent way of automatically
determining the URL conf for your API.

They are used by simply instantiating a Router class, and then registering
all the required ViewSets with that router.

For example, you might have a `urls.py` that looks something like this:

    router = routers.DefaultRouter()
    router.register('users', UserViewSet, 'user')
    router.register('accounts', AccountViewSet, 'account')

    urlpatterns = router.urls
"""
router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'users', views.UserViewSet)
router.register(r'groups', views.GroupViewSet)

# Wire up our API using automatic URL routing.
# Additionally, we include login URLs for the browsable API.
urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
]
